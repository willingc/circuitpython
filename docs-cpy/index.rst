Welcome! This documentation covers Adafruit CircuitPython's low-level API, and
these docs may link out to separate "getting started" guides.
`Adafruit <https://adafruit.com>`_ has many excellent tutorials and user
documentation available through the 
`Adafruit Learning System <https://learn.adafruit.com/>`_. 

Adafruit CircuitPython is an open source derivative of
`MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ for use on educational development
boards designed and sold by `Adafruit <https://adafruit.com>`_. Adafruit
CircuitPython features unified Python core APIs and a growing list of
drivers that work with it.

The Adafruit Express line of boards are specifically designed for use with
CircuitPython. This includes:
* `CircuitPlayground Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333>`_,
* `Feather M0 Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403>`_,
* `Metro M0 Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505>`_.

Other supported Adafruit boards include:
* `Arduino Zero <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero>`_, 
* `Adafruit Feather M0 Basic <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772>`_,
* `Adafruit Feather HUZZAH <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821>`_,
* `Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2995>`_.
