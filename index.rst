Welcome! This is the Adafruit CircuitPython API reference documentation.
**Adafruit CircuitPython** is an open
source derivative of `MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ for use on
educational development boards designed and sold by `Adafruit
<https://adafruit.com>`_. Adafruit CircuitPython features unified Python core
APIs and a growing list of drivers that work with it.

The Adafruit Express line of boards are specifically
designed for use with CircuitPython. The line includes:

* `CircuitPlayground Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333>`_
* `Feather M0 Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403>`_
* `Metro M0 Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505>`_

Other supported boards include:

* `Arduino Zero <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero>`_
* `Adafruit Feather M0 Basic <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772>`_
* `Adafruit Feather HUZZAH <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821>`_
* `Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2995>`_

`Adafruit <https://adafruit.com>`_ has many excellent tutorials available
through the `Adafruit Learning System <https://learn.adafruit.com/>`_. These
docs are low-level API docs and may link out to separate getting started guides.
