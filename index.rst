Welcome! This is the documentation for Adafruit CircuitPython. It is an open
source derivative of `MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ for use on
educational development boards designed and sold by `Adafruit
<https://adafruit.com>`_ including the:
    - `Arduino Zero <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero>`_,
    - `Adafruit Feather M0 Basic <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772>`_,
    - `Adafruit Feather HUZZAH <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821>`_, and
    - `Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2995>`_.

Adafruit CircuitPython features unified Python hardware APIs available under
`!shared-bindings` and a growing list of drivers that work with it.

`Adafruit <https://adafruit.com>`_ has many excellent tutorials available
through the `Adafruit Learning System <https://learn.adafruit.com/>`_.

This documentation contains low-level API docs that may link out to separate
getting started guides, such as on the Adafruit Learning System.
